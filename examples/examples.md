# Examples

## calc.ascii2
First enter a number, an operation (+-*/) and a second number. It will calculate the result.
(Note: Dividing with the first number larger than 10000 can take really really long, the division routine is really unoptimized)

## HelloWorld.ascii2
Will print "Hello, World!"

## cat.ascii2
Enter a string and get the same string back.

## minusone.ascii2
Prints -1

## thruth_machine.ascii2
* Enter a 0 -> output 0 once
* Enter a 1 -> output 1 infinitely
